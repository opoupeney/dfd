Development Process

Incremental Development with DreamFace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DreamFace supports an incremental development process.

**Creating an Application**
**Creating Application Components**
    **Create View Components**
    **Create API Routes**
    **Create Pages**
    **Add Views to a Page**
    **Add Page to Navigation Menu**
**Build and Deploy an Application**
**Dockerize an Application

**Top-Down or Bottom up Development**

DreamFace supports both top-down and bottom-up development.

**Top-Down** development in DreamFace starts by defining the User Interface of the application. Top-Down development can be
used for quick prototyping, by first defining application navigation with the Navigation Menu and the corresponding Pages linked to each
menu item, then progressively adding the application View components, binding (or linking) them to either pre-defined
or newly defined API Routes to access and visualize the data in the Views. These Views are then added to the Pages in a
composition to perform an application funtionality like searching for a Client Name and displaying the corresponding client
data.

Most developers prefer the **Bottom-Up** approach to applcation development. In DreamFace, bottom-up development means starting
with the data, then create the :term::`Ã™I` to display the data, the layout and the application navigation.

The bottom-up development process with DreamFace would look like this:

* Create the *Application* and specify whether it's a desktop or mobile application. The process described below is for desktop applications.
* Create the *API Services and API Routes* that access the data and test that they work by looking at the metadata and data returned.
* Create *Views* which consume, display and interact (create, update, delete) with the data coming from the API Routes. Views can be previewed directly in the View Editor to make sure they work.
* Add a Menu Item to the *Navigation Menu* and associate that item with a Page of the application to define the application flow.
* Add Views in a layout composition of rows and columns on the *Page* to create the :term:`UI` of the app.
* *Build and Deploy* the Application.
* *Modify Application Configuration and Settings* properties to reflect desired behavior of the app.
* *Dockerize* the application.

Once you have a Menu Item that displays a Page containing a composition of Views that may or may not be bound to API Routes,
you can deploy and test the application.

The DreamFace Compiler will indicate 'success' or 'failed' when the Build is complete. In the case of a 'failed' build you will
be notified of which Views failed to compile and supplied with a log file that helps to identify where the build broke down. In
the case of 'success' you will want to test the application page flow and data access.

DreamFace development is an **iteration process**, starting after the creation of the application, adding components, testing
and ending when the final version of application is deployed.

Once you have a working application and you are satisfied with its behavior, as a final step you can dockerize the application.
