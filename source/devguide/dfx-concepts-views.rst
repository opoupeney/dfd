Views and ViewCards
===================



DreamFace *Views* are visual components used to build the :term:UI` of your application. They are one of the fundamental
components of a DreamFace application. Views can be used to collect user input and display data. A view might contain a
form to fill in some information or might display a list of items coming from an API call. Views can be bound to API Routes
and consume and display API data.

Views are arranged on a :term:`Page`, either separately or combined with other Views. The :term:`UI` of your application
is madef from a composition of one or more Views arranged on a :term:`Page.

Views are created in the View Editor have three main parts that need to be defined:

The Design, the Script and the Styles:

 which includes the layout and the graphical controls that will be displayed, the behavior which is defined the Script and the Styles which can be defined by setting properties

**Design**
The design of the View is done in the :term:`View Editor` by dragging and dropping pre-defined :term:`Graphical Controls` on
the :term:`Canvas`and defining their term:`Properties`.

DreamFace Views support Single Page Applications (term:`SPA`) at the View level by using ViewCards. Each View can have
multiple definitions. Each definition is called a ViewCard. There is one default ViewCard which is necessary for any View.

At design time, the default ViewCard is displayed and each additional ViewCard is accessible for definition from tabs. The
designer’s toolbar provides options to create or delete ViewCards with the exception of the default ViewCard which is required.
Clicking on a Tab will display the content of the corresponding ViewCard and allow the developer to modify the definition by
adding or removing graphical controls and defining their properties.

At runtime, the default ViewCard is displayed when the View is rendered for the first time. The other ViewCards can be displayed
programmatically either in a dialog box (using the dfxDialog.showCard() function), in a left or right sidepanel or as a bottom sheet.

**Script**
Each View has an associated script that is defined in the :term:`Script Editor. In DreamFace scripts are written in pure
Javascript and Angular.js. The associated help provides templates for creating different types of scripts like controllers
and functions.

**Styles**
Each View has associated styles which are defined directly in the properties of each graphical control on the View or in the
Styles editor of the View.


Name
    Title

    NO - We need to be able to define the size (mainly width?) of the viewCard? “SizeTofit” or percentages of the main ViewCard can be helpful?
    NO - Do we need to have a “default behaviour” for the viewCard so if it is opened with an “empty mode” it will follow a left nav (for example)?
    YES - ViewCards share the same main controller (same Angular module)
    This is not part of the card definition - Different style of representations to be supported:
    Left Nav/RightNav/Bottom Nav (not sure why not upNav as well?)
    As overlay to current ViewCard or “by pushing the curent viewCard”
    Popup in a dialog: should the dialog be centered within the viewCard or within the page in which the viewCard is rendered?
    Name should be unique to this view since it will be used to call it with YES

| Name                   | rtRating#         | Name is a reference to the component's DOM element. It can be used to dynamically access   |
|                        |                   | and set component properties. DreamFace gives a default name of *rtRating#* where #        |
|                        |                   | corresponds to the order in which it was created. If it's the second rating control created|
|                        |                   | will have a default Name of *rtRating2*. Name is not required and can be removed if not    |
