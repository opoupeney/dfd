Graphical Controls Reference
============================

DreamFace is designed to help you build both web and mobile applications and provides specific editors for building Web,
Tablet and cross-platform Mobile user interfaces:

* **Web UI** - built to run desktop browser-based applications. Because it is :term:`responsive` it can also be used from mobile devices in a mobile browser.
* **Tablet UI** - built specifically for tablets with a View editor tailored to tablet application controls
* **Mobile UI** - built specifically for mobile apps with a View editor tailored to mobile application UI controls. It can also generate a zip file for Phonegap Build to create a cross-platform version for different mobile operating systems.

Building web applications requires different graphical controls than tablet or a mobile applications due to the screen size
and the need to present information differently. For this reason, DreamFace includes three different versions of the View editor,
one for building the user interface of web applications, one for building the UI of tablet apps and one for mobile apps. Each
editor contains its own set of pre-defined graphical controls for building Views. Pre-defined graphical controls are
:term:`UI` components that are ready to be use in Views like input fields, buttons, tables, charts and panels. In the View Editor
you drag and drop these controls onto a panel and set properties for the specific functionality required by your application.

The same API Service Objects and their corresponding API Services can be used by both web, tablet and mobile applications.

For a detailed explanation of each View Editor's pre-defined graphical controls in the sections below:
