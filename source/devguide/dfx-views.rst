A DreamFace :term:`view` is a visual component and one of the fundamental components of a DreamFace application. Views have
three main parts that need to be defined:

Design
The design of the View is done in the :term:`View Editor by dragging and dropping pre-defined `term:`Graphical Controls` on
to the :term:`Canvas and defining their `term:`Properties.

Script
Each View has an associated script that is defined in the :term:`Script Editor. In DreamFace scripts are written in pure
Javascript and Angular.js

Styles
Each View has associated styles.
