Web Application Graphical Controls
==================================

DreamFace uses Angular Material to define the look and feel of web application graphical controls.

Once the view is created you have access to the View Editor containing the pre-defined graphical controls for building
web apps. The pre-defined graphical controls are grouped into categories with similar functionality:
