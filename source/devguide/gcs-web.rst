Web Application Graphical Controls
==================================

DreamFace uses Angular Material to define the look and feel of web application graphical controls.

When creating your application you specify if it is a web or mobile application. Web applications will automatically
have access to the View Editor containing the pre-defined graphical controls for building web apps. The pre-defined
graphical controls are divided into several categories of similar functionality:

* **Basic** - Basic controls are simple graphical controls that do not require user input.
* **Input** - Input controls are simple graphical controls that are usually associated with only one input field and value.
* **Menu** - Menu controls are graphical controls that are used to create menus.
* **Selection** - Selection controls are graphical controls that are used to selection items from a list.
* **Table** - Table controls are used to present and manage the presentation of information in table format.
* **Chart** - Charts controls are different types of pre-defined charts used to present data in a graph format.
* **Layout** - Layout controls are containers for other graphical controls, organized in rows and columns.
