Graphical Controls
------------------

DreamFace is designed to help you build both web and cross-platform mobile applications.

When deciding which kind of interface you want for your applications, you have a few different options:

* **Web UI** - built to run desktop browser-based applications. Because it is :term:`responsive` it can also be used from mobile devices in a mobile browser.
* **Mobile UI** - built specifically for mobile apps and can generate a zip file for Phonegap Build to create a cross-platform version for different mobile operating systems.

Building web applications requires different graphical controls than mobile applications due to the screen size and need
to present information differently. For this reason, DreamFace includes two different View editors, one for building the user
interface of web applications and one for building the UI of mobile apps. Each editor contains its own set of pre-defined
graphical controls. Pre-defined graphical controls are :term:`UI` components that are ready to use in Views like input fields,
buttons, tables, charts and panels. In the visual View Editor you drag and drop these controls onto a panel and set properties
for the specific functionality required by your application.

The same API Services and their corresponding API Routes can be used by both web and mobile applications.

For a detailed explanation of each View Editor's pre-defined graphical controls in the sections below.
