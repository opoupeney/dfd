DreamFace X-Platform (DFX or just DreamFace as we will refer to it in this documentation) is a part of emerging category of cloud-native Rapid
Application Development Platforms for delivering Enterprise scale Web and Mobile applications with ease and speed, producing uncompromising User
Experiences, and delivering the right data to the right user on the right device by secure and code-less consumption of any public or private API.

DreamFace accelerates development with a Widget Editor providing drag and drop development. In the Widget Editor, pre-defined graphical controls are
dragged on to an panel and properties and attributes are set, minimizing the coding required and allowing developers to focus on creating the user
experience. Developers can drop into code when the user interface requires specific customization and they have always have access to underlying assets
of the application in the DreamFace Repository which contains a description of each component in JSON format.

DreamFace was created to ease development of two difficult and time consuming tasks:

* **User Interface** - industrialize and simplify the creation of beautiful, complex user interfaces for multiples screens
* **Back-End Data Integration** - codeless and secure intregration of virtually any API or back-end data source

The X-Platform part of the DreamFace name refers to the cross platform development. With DreamFace you can build applications for web or mobile with dedicated editors for creating the user interface for web and mobile environments. DreamFace offers several options. You can create a responsive web application that adapts to web and mobile use by adjusting to the screen size of the device automatically in a responsive way or you can create specific Web and Mobile versions of your application that reuse the same back-end query components. In the case of mobile deployment DreamFace provides tools to create cross platform mobile versions of your application. This flexibility lets you decide which is the best platform for your application.

DreamFace is built on the MEAN Stack, MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angularjs and Nodejs.
