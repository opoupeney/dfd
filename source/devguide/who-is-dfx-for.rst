Who is DreamFace for?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**DreamFace is for Developers**

DreamFace was built to empower :term:`Full Stack` developers by leveraging best of breed technologies like Angularjs, Nodejs and MongoDB that
were developed and used to create the internets most demanding applications. DreamFace embraces these new technologies and
builds on them, providing a open and extensible platform with built-in best practices for building cloud-native desktop and
mobile applications. Multi-tenancy and enterprise-scale features are built-in and ready to use to help developers deliver
consistently well architected and scalable applications every time.

Because of it's modular approach to development, DreamFace allows teams of different skill levels to work together and leverage
each others core competence to the benefit the project. A developer who is much better at building the user interface and knows
web technologies could create the Navigation Menus, Views and Application Pages (compositions of Views), a graphist could choose a
theme, create any images needed  and general look and feel of the application and a developer with more back-end skills could create
the API Services and Routes to access the backend data. Then just put them together to build the app and visualise the data.
Application components can be added to Shared Components and reused in different applications. API Routes can be used for both desktop
and mobile applications.

Developers donâ€™t have to be experts in each individual language to put together applications and services.
