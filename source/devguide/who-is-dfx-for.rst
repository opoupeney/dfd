Who is DreamFace for?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**DreamFace is for Developers**

DreamFace was built to empower developers by leveraging best of breed technologies like Angularjs, Nodejs and MongoDB that were developed and used to
create the internets most demanding applications. DreamFace embraces these new technologies and builds on them providing a open and extensible platform
with built-in best practices for building cloud-native desktop and mobile applications. Multi-tenancy and enterprise-scale features are built-in and
ready to use to help the developer to deliver consistently well architected and scalable applications every time.

Because of it's modular approach to development, DreamFace allows teams of different skill levels to work together and leverage each others core competence
to the benefit the project. A developer who is much better at building the user interface and knows web technologies could create the Navigation Menus, Views,
and Application Pages (compositions of Views), a graphist could create the the images, color scheme and general look and feel of the application and a
developer with more back-end skills would create the API Services and Routes to access the backend data. Then just put them together to build the app and
visualise the data. The same API Routes can be used for both web and mobile applications.
