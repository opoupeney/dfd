Understanding DreamFace
=======================

What is DreamFace?
------------------
DreamFace X-Platform (DFX) or just DreamFace as we will refer to it throughout this documentation is a Cloud based development
platform that empowers developers to consistently deliver well-architected Enterprise grade Cloud applications, with Ease and Speed,
resulting in an uncompromising personalized User Experience with the right data on the right device for the right user, with codeless
integration of virtually any enterprise service, process, public or private API available.

DreamFace accelerates development and leaves room for developer creativity in solving business problems by removing much of the heavy-lifting
in writing application logic, connecting to multiple data sources and packaging applications. Developers focus their development on
creating a compelling user experience with reduced coding required because a comprehensive integration of backend data services with
codelss consumption or APIs.

DreamFace is based on the technologies proven by the major internet application providers like facebook, twitter and google.

It’s componentization, it’s modularity, interoperability   Open APIs is another reason?. Developers


Why did we create DreamFace?
----------------------------

The success of social media applications on the internet has lead to a proliferation of new and robust open source technologies. It has
also created expectations with end users for beautiful and intuitive user interfaces. At the same, IT departments and businesses have
been opening up there back-end data and applications as services through the creation of pubic and private APIs. This new trends toward
componentization and modularity have transformed application development. Developers no longer have to create everything from scratch
in monolithic projects that take way too long and cost way too much. Application development today is an assembly of pieces coming from
different libraries, languages, frameworks and technologies.

Businesses are in a difficult situation because they want to take advantage of the flexibility offered by these new open source technologies.
They want the software and the apis they use be open and extensible. They want to be able to customize the pieces and interface with existing
applications, public and external data sources and legacy technology. There is an expectation of great benefit by using these new
components and technologies and at the same time there isn't a lot of experience about how to put it all together so they need guidance. They
have real applications to build and real delerivables, real budgets and real security needs to meet. The question they are asking is
how can we benefit from these new development methodologies and deliver on out commitments.

That's where DreamFace steps in. DreamFace was built to leverage these new open source technologies to :

* **Create modern and beautiful User Interfaces** and
* **Integrete back-end data sources coming from any API**

Like many frameworks and platforms, DreamFace was created to help reduce the amount of work to build consistently good applications.
There are  a lot of great developers in the world and many more will come with the new coding initiatives. The problem isn’t really knowing
HTML or CSS, or Angular or any other new technology that comes along. The problem is knowing all of the technologies necessary to build a
really good application that works in the cloud and scales and that can evolve and adapt to the ever changing business requirements
of today's competetive business environment.

The goal of DreamFace is to reduce the need to know every technology in depth by providing built-in best practices for error handling,
API integration, security, version management, team development, build management and deployment and containerization to name a few.
DreamFace provides and open and exetensible environment where the developer is empowered to use their skills to focus on the functionality
and providing a great user experience without rebuilding the wheel every time.

DreamFace can also leverage the experts in a project. For example, one developer could build the complex data queries that can be reused by
the rest of the team. Being able to share reusable components allows a team to build a catalogue of shared components that they can leverage.

**Some of the ways DreamFace helps to empower developers:**

* A Software Development PaaS enabling developers to collaborate in the development of Web and Mobile apps
* Built on Open Source technologies and Frameworks (NodeJS, AngularJS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, GITHub…)
* Leverages all the capabilities and power of this selection of technologies
* Allows all levels of developers to contribute on the same project, each using a preferred technique to do so
* Designed to evolve architecturally but transparently to developers and user (such as adding a new open source framework, a new graphical component library, etc.)
* Structures the way developers need to use these technologies by wrapping best practices around them


What does it mean that DreamFace is a Cloud Platform?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

?? We need a diagram for this.

* DreamFac is a platform to build applications


What does DreamFace do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Virtually connects to any API (JSON/REST) directly or through a hub (such as Cast Iron Live, IIB, any Middleware solution)
* Introspect, Choreograph, consume and generate widgets from any API
* Assemble Widgets to produce Cloud apps for mobile or Web



DreamFace Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DreamFace was built with a few fundamental concepts in mind.

Rich Interactive User Experience
--------------------------------
DreamFace-powered applications use Angular to deliver desktop-like interactivity without a plug-in or install and work across
the most popular browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari). Developers use a visual form designer with a wide range of Ajax controls and a flexible geometry model to efficiently create intuitive user experiences and unlock new application value. Bungee takes a unique approach to Ajax using a generalized Javascript engine for all applications rather than requiring custom Javascript development or dynamic code generation. While DreamFace offers a wide range of commonly used controls, you can extend the library of available controls with your own Ajax controls to leverage custom controls you may have previously built.


Architecture Matters
--------------------
Great Applications need a Solid Architecture^


Open and Extensible
-------------------
In addition to being open-source software DreamFace provides open assets like the DreamFace Repository which contains a complete JSON description of all DreamFace Components.

Loosely Coupled to Backend Data
-------------------------------

DreamFace automates the connectivity to multiple data sources including SOAP and REST services and MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
Whether the services are broadly available public services or private business services, DreamFace developers can leverage those
services in new ways. DreamFace can also make legacy applications available as a service to be used in your applications. Data sources are accessed through the Bungee servers, not the client, enabling more security for the data and a wider range of connectivity options within applications.


Developer Collaboration
-----------------------

DreamFace supports teams of developers with an integrated source control system. No need to juggle versions of application
code between code repositories and environments as the team collaborates on the application. Starting a team development
project is easy — just create a DesignGroup and invite the other team members. With no configuration, the team is now ready to begin development. This approach enables code sharing without a complicated setup.

Application Delivery
--------------------
DreamFace eliminates the burdens of purchasing, building and maintaining application infrastructure. DreamFace offers the
Bungee Sandbox as a free place to deploy your applications and test them with your team and end users.

Cloud-Native Development and Deployment
---------------------------------------
DreamFace is a cloud-native development and deployment platform. This means that DreamFace itself is a full-fledged cloud applicaiton
and all applications created with DreamFace are also cloud-native, multi-tenant and cloud ready.


Build and Deployment Management
-------------------------------

Managing deployed applications is very simple — just a couple of clicks for a new deployment or to update to a new version.
Applications can be delivered as standalone solutions or embedded directly inside an existing web application or SaaS solution.
Applications delivered as stand-alone solutions can use any domain name managed by the developer. Applications that compliment
existing applications can be embedded directly into the application, even with single sign-on capability, giving users a seamless
experience.


Built-in Security
-----------------

DreamFace has been architected to take a comprehensive approach to application and data security.
