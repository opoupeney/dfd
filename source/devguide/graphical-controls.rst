Graphical Controls
------------------

DreamFace is designed to help you build both web and cross-platform mobile applications.

You have a few different options when deciding which interface to build for your applications:

* **Web UI** - built mainly to run on web browsers and because it is :term:`responsive` it can also used from mobile devices in the mobile browser.
* **Mobile UI** - built specifically for mobile apps and can generate a zip file for Phonegap Build to create a cross-platform version for different mobile operating system.

Building web applications requires different graphical controls than mobile applications due to the screen size and need
to present information differently. For this reason, DreamFace includes two different View editors, one for building web
applications and one for building mobile apps. Each editor contains its own set of pre-defined graphical controls.
Pre-defined graphical controls are :term:`UI` components that are ready to use in Views like input fields, buttons, tables,
charts and panels. In the visual View Editor you drag and drop these controls onto a panel and set properties for the specific
functionality required by your application.

For a detailed explanation of each View Editor's pre-defined graphical controls in the sections below.
