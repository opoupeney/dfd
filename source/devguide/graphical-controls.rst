Graphical Controls
------------------

DreamFace is designed to help you build both desktop and cross-platform mobile applications.

You have a few different options when deciding which interface to build for your applications:

* **Desktop UI** - built mainly to run on desktop browsers but can also be :term:`responsive` and used on mobile browsers as well.
* **Mobile UI** - built specifically for mobile apps and can generate a zip file for phonegap build to create a cross-platform version for different mobile operating systems.

Building web applications requires different graphical controls than mobile applications due to the screen size and need to present information differently.
For this reason, DreamFace includes two different widget editors, one for building web applications and one for mobile apps. Each widget editor contains its own set of pre-defined graphical controls.
Pre-defined graphical controls are components that are ready to use in widgets like input fields, buttons, grids, and panels. In the visual widget editor you drag and drop these controls onto a panel and set properties for
the specific functionality required by your application.

For a detailed explanation of each widget editor's pre-defined graphical controls a list will be provided.
