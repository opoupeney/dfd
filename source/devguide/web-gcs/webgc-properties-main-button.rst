| Id                     | nnnnn             | Id is a unique identifier that is 5 or more digits long. It is generated by DreamFace and  |
|                        |                   | can be used when refering to this field in script.                                         |

| Template               | template name     | Name of the template to be used as the basis of the current Statictext control.            |
|                        |                   | For more information on how to use Templates see :ref:`dfx-templates-label`                |

| Name                   | txtText#          | Name is a reference to the component's DOM element. It can be used to dynamically access   |
|                        |                   | and set component properties. DreamFace gives a default name of the graphical component    |
|                        |                   | followed a number which cooresponds to the order in which the control was created. For     |
|                        |                   | for a statictext *txtText#*. The second statictext created will have a default Name of     |
|                        |                   | *txtText2*. Name is not required and can be removed if not needed.                         |
+------------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Text                   | Any text or       | Any text that will be displayed in the field. It should be in quotes, otherwise it will be |
|                        | angular expression| treated as a variable.                                                                     |

|                        |                   | **Text can also be an angular expression** which will be evaluated at runtime.             |

|                        |                   |                                                                                            |
|                        |                   | **Note** - If your label doesn't appear in Preview mode, make sure the text is in quotes.  |
|                        |                   | If you have an angular expression that does not appear in Preview mode it means that their |
|                        |                   | most likely an error in your angular expression. Take a look at the sample angular         |
|                        |                   | expressions in the Samples Gallery. If your expression contains an apostrophe, use double  |
|                        |                   | quotes. For example "It's a button" would evaluate to: *It's a button* at runtime or in    |
|                        |                   | in Preview Mode when testing the View.                                                     |
|                        |                   |                                                                                            |

| Display                | *true* or *false* | The value can either be a literal *true* to display the field or *false* to hide it, or it |
|                        | angular expression| can be a angular expression that evaulates to *true* or *false*, for example,              |
|                        |                   | 5 > 2 would evaluate to *true* and 5 < 2 would evaluate to *false*. It is also possible    |
|                        |                   | to use $scope variables that are already defined.                                          |
|                        |                   |                                                                                            |

|                        |                   | indicating existing scope variables and functions. You can use scope variables as part of  |
|                        |                   | of your angular expression, for example, myVar == 5, would evaluate the expression using   |
|                        |                   | the value stored in the scope variable myVar, if equal to 5 the expression would evaluate  |
|                        |                   | to **true** and the text would be displayed.                                               |
|                        |                   |                                                                                            |
