| **Main Properties**    | Possible Values    | Description                                                                                |
+========================+====================+============================================================================================+
| **Id**                 | nnnnn              | Id is a unique :term:`GC` identifier that is a string of 5 or more digits long. It is      |
|                        |                    | generated by DreamFace and can be used when refering to this field in script.              |
+------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Template**           | template name      | This is the chosen name of the :term:`GC` template to be used as the basis of the current  |
|                        |                    | :term:`GC`. It is set to 'default' by default. For more information on how to use Templates|
|                        |                    | see :ref:`dfx-templates-label`.                                                            |

| **Name**               | gcName#            | This is the technical name of the Graphical Control. It is a reference to the component's  |
|                        |                    | DOM element. It can be used to dynamically access and set component properties. DreamFace  |
|                        |                    | gives a default name that refers to the :term:`GC` followed a number which cooresponds to  |
|                        |                    | the order in which the control was created. Name is not required and can be removed if not |
|                        |                    | needed. For a complete list see :ref:`style-gcnames-label`.                                |
+------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Binding**            | scope variable     | Binding is a Graphical Control input property to databind to a scope variable. A scope     |
|                        |                    | variable name can be added directly typing the name in the Binding property field or by    |
|                        |                    | choosing from a list of possible scope variables listed in the Dialog Help. Dialog help can|
|                        |                    | be reached by clicking **...** on the right hand side of the Binding field.                |
|                        |                    |                                                                                            |
|                        |                    | Bindings can be simple or complex:                                                         |
|                        |                    |                                                                                            |
|                        |                    | * Simple Binding - scope variable name, for example *myVar*                                |
|                        |                    | * Complex Binding - a path to the scope variable, for example *myArray[3].myVar*           |
|                        |                    |                                                                                            |
|                        |                    | If the :term:`GC` is in a repeatable panel and needs to be bound to a repeatable item, use |
|                        |                    | *$dfx_item.myVar* to get the value. For more information on $dfx_item see                  |
|                        |                    | :ref:`gcs-dfx-varibles`                                                                    |
|                        |                    |                                                                                            |
+------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Text** or **Label**  | Any text in quotes | Any Text / Label that will be displayed in the field. It should be in quotes, otherwise it |
|                        |         or         | will be interpreted as a scope variable.                                                   |
|                        | angular expression |                                                                                            |
|                        |         or         | Text / Label can also be an angular expression which will be evaluated at runtime.         |
|                        | scope variable     |                                                                                            |
|                        |                    | See more about how to define an :ref:`angular-expression-label` here.                      |
|                        |                    |                                                                                            |
|                        |                    | **Note** - If your text / label does not appear in Preview mode, make sure the text is in  |
|                        |                    |  quotes. If you have an angular expression that does not appear in Preview mode it could   |
|                        |                    | mean that there is an error in your angular expression. Take a look at the sample angular  |
|                        |                    | expressions in the Samples Gallery. If your expression contains an apostrophe, use double  |
|                        |                    | quotes. For example "It's a button" would evaluate to: *It's a button* at runtime or in    |
|                        |                    | in Preview Mode when testing the View Editor.                                              |
|                        |                    |                                                                                            |
|                        |                    | Text / Label can also be a scope variable. The scope variable name can be added directly   |
|                        |                    | in the Text / Label property field or can be chosen from a list of possible scope variables|
|                        |                    | in the Dialog Help. Dialog help can be reached by clicking **...** on the right side of the|
|                        |                    | Text / Label property field.                                                               |
|                        |                    |                                                                                            |
|                        |                    | Scope variables can be simple or complex:                                                  |
|                        |                    |                                                                                            |
|                        |                    | * Simple  - scope variable name, for example *myVar*                                       |
|                        |                    | * Complex - a path to the scope variable, for example *myArray[3].myVar*                   |
|                        |                    |                                                                                            |
|                        |                    | If the :term:`GC` is in a repeatable panel and needs to be bound to a repeatable item, use |
|                        |                    | *$dfx_item.myVar* to get the value. For more information on $dfx_item see                  |

| **Icon**               | favicon            | Click on the **...** to the right of the field to display a list of icons                  |
|                        |                    | :ref:`dfx-icons-label` to select from.                                                     |
|                        |                    |                                                                                            |
+------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Icon Position**      | *Left* or          | The icon can be positionned on the right, left or center of the Label. *Center* position   |
|                        | *Center* or        | only works if the Label is empty or blank. If *center* selected as the icon position when  |
|                        | *Right*            | the Label is not blank, the position will default to *left*.                               |

|                        |                    | Select one of the options *Left*, *Center* or *Right* to display the icon in that postion. |
|                        |                    | In this example *left* is selected (also the default)                                      |

| **Display**            | *true* or *false*  | This is a property to show or hide the :ter:`GC`.                                          |
|                        |        or          | The value can either be a literal *true* to display the field or *false* to hide it, or it |
|                        | boolean expression | can be a angular expression that evaulates to *true* or *false*, for example,              |
|                        |        or          | 5 > 2 would evaluate to *true* and 5 < 2 would evaluate to *false*. It is also possible    |
|                        |  scope variable    | to use a $scope variable that are already defined.                                         |

|                        |                    | expression is available. Click on the *...** and a Expression Editor will be displayed,    |
|                        |                    | indicating existing scope variables and functions. You can use scope variables as part of  |
|                        |                    | of your angular expression, for example, myVar == 5, would evaluate the expression using   |
|                        |                    | the value stored in the scope variable myVar, if equal to 5 the expression would evaluate  |
