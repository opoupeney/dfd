Tooltip Text
============

This is the text of the tooltip. The tooltip provides instructions to help guide the user. It will be displayed
when mouse passes over the :term:`GC`. The Text can also be an expression,`.

**Values:**

* **'string'** in quotes - text should be in quotes, otherwise it will be interpreted as a scope variable.
* **angular expression** - an expression that evalutates to a string, for example 'this is the tool' + 'TIP' would display *this is the toolTIP*. Angular expressions are evaluated at runtime.
* **$scope variable** - defined in the script of the View in the Script Editor, ie. $scope.myString = 'Hello World'.

**Default:** *None*

**Notes:** If your text does not appear in Preview mode, make sure the text is in quotes. If you have an angular
expression that does not appear in Preview mode it could mean that there is an error in your angular expression. Take a
look at the sample angular expressions in the Samples Gallery. If your expression contains an apostrophe, use double
quotes. For example "It's a button" would evaluate to: *It's a button* at runtime or in
in Preview Mode when testing the View Editor.

Text can also be a scope variable. The scope variable name can be added directly in the Text property
field or can be chosen from a list of possible scope variables in the Dialog Help. Dialog help can be reached by
clicking **...** on the right side of the Text property field.

Scope variables can be simple or complex:

* Simple  - scope variable name, for example *myVar*
* Complex - a path to the scope variable, for example *myArray[3].myVar*
