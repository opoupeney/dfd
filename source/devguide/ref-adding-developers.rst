Adding Developers
=================

Adding developers to DreamFace is a straighforward task.

Developers are created at the Platform level (above applications). All parameters set at the Platform level are global.
This is normal since each developer can work on more than one application.

From the Platform / Developers menu click on Developers.

When adding developers for the first time after creating our app, there is already one existing developer which is *admin*,
the application administrator. This shouldn't be a surprise since we need one developer to start with to create the others.

   Figure : *admin is the only developer available at the beginning*

We are going to create a fictious demo developer called Jack Russel. Just fill in the fields. Login is the username that Jack
will use to Sign In.

Now we can click on the Roles tab and set Jack's role to developer.

When all fields have been filled in and Jack's role has been defined, click on Save to save the definition of our new developer.
