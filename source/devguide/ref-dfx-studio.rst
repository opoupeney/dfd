The Left Nav also contains a Search field to search for all components for a given name. Just enter the name of the component
you are searching for and click on the search Icon. All components with that name will be listed.

By default, the platform displays application statistcs for each app and information about components shared across
applications when no other action has been requested. Search, would be another action and it replaces the stats when it displays
the search results here. If your application statistics have been replaced by another action, just click on the *Home* icon
and they will be redisplayed.

The Stats give us a quick look at the application. In the example above the application called Test has 1 Page, 1 View and
no API Services. The application called TestApp has 1 Page, 0 Views and 0 API Services

The Application Explorer is presented with a TreeMenu control. The firs level of the menu contains:

* **Platform**
* **Application**
* **Shared Catalog**
