**Stats**

By default, the platform displays application statistcs for each app and information about components shared across
applications. The main part of the screen or canvas is where action results are displayed. For instance, Search, would be
another action and it replaces the stats in the canvas when it displays the search results. If your application statistics
have been replaced by another action, just click on the *Home* icon and they will be redisplayed.

The Stats give us a quick look at the application. In the example above the application called Test has 1 Page, 1 View and
no API Services. The application called TestApp has 1 Page, 0 Views and 0 API Services
