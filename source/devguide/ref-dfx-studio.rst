**Stats**

By default, the platform displays application statistcs for each app in the tenant as well as information about components
shared across applications. The main part of the screen or canvas is where results are displayed after some action is done.
For instance, when you search on a name, the results of the search are displayed in the canvas and replace the stats. To
redisplay your application statistics, just click on the *Home* icon.

The Stats give us a quick look at the application. In the example above the application called Test has 1 Page, 1 View and
no API Services. The application called TestApp has 1 Page, 0 Views and 0 API Services
