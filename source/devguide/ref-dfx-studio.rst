Exploring The Studio
====================

The DreamFace Studio is the place where DreamFace developers create beautiful, scalable, enterprise applications.

It is a complete platform for creating, building and deploying DreamFace applications. In the
DreamFace application architecture it corresponds to the node application (DFX) and contains both development and runtime
environments. For more information on the architecture see :ref:`platform-architecture-label`

In the tutorial below you will learn how to navigate and find your way around the Studio.

The Explorer
------------

On the left side of the page underneath the platform name is the Explorer panel. The Explorer contains thre options: Platform,
Applications and Shared Catalogue. It is organized in a tree structure for easily navigating through the different setting
and components when creating your applications.

|

.. image:: ../images/devguide/dfx-studio-1pg-explorerx.png

A platform can have one or more applications and each application has its own configuration and components. Shared Catalogue
contains components that can be used across different applications.

The Explorer can be collapsed to get more screen real estate by clicking on the

**Search**

The Explorer also contains a Search field to search for all components for a given name. Just enter the name of the component
you are searching for and click on the search Icon. All components with that name will be listed in the canvas area of the page.

The Canvas
----------

**Stats**

By default, the platform displays application statistcs for each app in the tenant as well as information about components
shared across applications. The main part of the screen or canvas is where results are displayed after some action is done.
For instance, when you search on a name, the results of the search are displayed in the canvas and replace the stats. To
redisplay your application statistics, just click on the *Home* icon.

The Stats give us a quick look at the application. In the example above the application called Test has 1 Page, 1 View and
no API Services. The application called TestApp has 1 Page, 0 Views and 0 API Services
