Exploring The Studio
====================

The DreamFace Studio is the place where DreamFace developers create beautiful, scalable, enterprise applications.

It is a complete platform for creating, building and deploying your applications. In the DreamFace application
architecture the DreamFace Studio corresponds to the node application (DFX) and contains both development and runtime
environments. Development is truly dev and devops. For more information on the architecture see :ref:`platform-architecture-label`

In the tutorial below you will learn how to navigate and find your way around the Studio.

The Left Nav
------------

On the left side of the page is the App Explorer. The App Explorer contains thre options: Platform,
Applications and Shared Catalogue. It is organized in a tree structure for easily navigating through the different setting
and components when creating and modifying your applications.

|

.. image:: ../images/devguide/dfx-studio-hp-explorer.png

A platform can have one or more applications and each application has its own configuration and components. Shared Catalogue
contains components that can be used across different applications.

.. image:: ../images/devguide/dfx-studio-hp-leftnav.png

|

**Search**

At the top of the leftnav is a Search field to search for all components for a given name. Just enter the name of the
component that you are searching for and click on the search Icon. All components with that name will be listed in the
canvas area of the page.

**The Application Exporer**

A detailed look at the Application Explorer can be found here :ref:`dfx-studio-explorer-label`

The Canvas
----------

**App Statistics**

By default, the platform displays application statistcs for each application in the tenant as well as information about
components shared across applications. The main part of the screen or canvas is where results are displayed after some
action is completed.

This is where all the action takes place:

    * Information is diplayed
    * Applications get created
    * View, Pages and API get created and modified
    * Configuration setting are defined
    * The Application development workflow happens here

For example, when you search on a name, the results of the search are displayed in the canvas and replace the stats.
The Stats give us a snapshot of our application. In the example below the application called Test has 1
Page, 1 View and no API Services. The application called TestApp has 1 Page, 0 Views and 0 API Services

of the homepage iconbar.
