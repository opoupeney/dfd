DreamFace Philosophy
===================

The creators of DreamFace are all seasoned vetrans of Enterprise Development and Development Platforms. We built into DreamFace
the features that we would want as enterprise developers of applications that have to connect and scaled in one of most challenging
application development eras in the history of application development. Below you will find some of the things that you
too would expect from a modern enterprise development platform and some of our personal touch that makes
DreamFace unique.


Rich Interactive User Experience
--------------------------------
DreamFace-powered applications use Angular and Angular Material to deliver desktop-like interactivity without a plug-in or
install and work across the most popular browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari). Developers use a visual form
designer with a wide range of pre-defined graphical controls and a flexible layout to efficiently create intuitive user
experiences and unlock new application value. You can also extend DreamFace and create your own unique graphical controls.

existing applications can be embedded directly into the application, even with single sign-on capability, giving users a seamless
experience.
