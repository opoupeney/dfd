Connecting to Data with DreamFace
=================================

One of the main purposes of DreamFace is to bring together disparate data sources, private or public, to create a rich user experience.

The fundamental components of a DreamFace application reflect this. The **View** is a visual component that displays data
in context in a rich user interface and the **API Service** is the reusable component to access backend data REST API Services.

This refenence to connecting to data will discuss how to connect to the backend APIs to create the reusable API Servics and
API Service Objects.

The main topics relating to connecting to the data will be covered in the following sections:

* Creating a API Service to access a REST API
* Creating a Secure API Service
* Creating an API Service for CRUD operations
* Pre and Post Processing of API Services
* Creating an API Service to access a secure API
