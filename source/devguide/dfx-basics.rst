What is DreamFace?
==================

*DreamFace is an open-source, :term:`cloud-native` development platform for creating enterprise web and mobile applications.*

DreamFace X-Platform, (DFX) or just **DreamFace** as we will refer to it throughout this documentation, is part of an emerging
category of :term:`cloud-native`, Rapid Application Development (RAD) Platforms built to empower :term:`Fullstack` developers
in the delivery of consistently well-architected, Enterprise-grade, :term:`cloud-native`,  web and
mobile applications with ease and speed, producing uncompromising User Experiences and delivering the right data on the right
device by secure and code-less consumption of virtually any public or private API.

DreamFace accelerates development and leaves room for developer creativity to solve business problems by removing much of
the heavy-lifting in writing application logic, connecting to multiple data sources, providing security and packaging applications.
Developers focus their development on creating a compelling user experience with reduced coding required because a comprehensive
integration of backend data services with codelss consumption or APIs.

DreamFace was created to ease development of two difficult and time consuming tasks:

* **the User Interface** - industrialize and simplify the creation of beautiful, complex user interfaces for multiples screens
* **Back-End Data Integration** - codeless and secure intregration of virtually any API or back-end data source

DreamFace is built on the MEAN Stack, MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angularjs and Nodejs.

DreamFace applications are:

* modular built from a composition of user interface and data access components
* :term:`cloud-native` and :term:`multi-tenant` right out of the box
* multi-platform by nature, the underlying :term:`UI` is based on Angular Material
* based on best of breed, open-source technologies that are the foundation of the internet applications today from providers like facebook, twitter and google.
* are architected to scale to the limits of the cloud
* open-source but also open and extensible


The goal of DreamFace is to leverage best of breed technologies and empower developers to
create well-architected, beautiful and secure applications that are open and extensible, and scale to the limits of the cloud.
DreamFace helps developers focus on providing a great user experience by simplifying tedious and repetitive tasks and providing an
unparelled, out of the box fearture set.

DreamFace accelerates development with a Widget Editor providing drag and drop development. In the Widget Editor, pre-defined graphical controls are
dragged on to an panel and properties and attributes are set, minimizing the coding required and allowing developers to focus on creating the user
experience. Developers can drop into code when the user interface requires specific customization and they have always have access to underlying assets
of the application in the DreamFace Repository which contains a description of each component in JSON format.

Who is DreamFace for?
=====================

**DreamFace is for Developers**

DreamFace was built to empower :term:`Full Stack` developers by leveraging best of breed technologies like Angularjs, Nodejs and MongoDB that
were developed and used to create the internets most demanding applications. DreamFace embraces these new technologies and
builds on them, providing a open and extensible platform with built-in best practices for building cloud-native web and
mobile applications. Multi-tenancy and enterprise-scale features are built-in and ready to use to help developers deliver
consistently well architected and scalable applications every time.


Because of it's modular approach to development, DreamFace allows teams of different skill levels to work together and leverage
each others skills to the benefit the project. For example, a developer who is much better at building the user interface and
knows web technologies could create the Views and Pages (compositions of Views) and application branding and a developer
with more backend skills could create the API Services that access the backend data. Then just put them together to visualise
the data in the Views and Pages. The same API Services can be used for both web and mobile applications.

Developers don’t have to be experts in each individual language to put together applications and services.

Why did we create DreamFace?
============================

The success of social media applications on the internet has lead to a proliferation of new and robust open source technologies.
It has also created a lot of expectations with end users for beautiful and intuitive user interfaces. At the same, IT departments
and businesses have been opening up there back-end data and applications as services through the creation of pubic and private APIs.
These new trends toward componentization and modularity have transformed application development. Developers no longer have
to create everything from scratch in monolithic projects that take much too long and cost way too much. Application development
today is an assembly of pieces coming from different libraries, languages, frameworks and technologies and technology continues
to evolve.

DreamFace was build in this world, to leverage these new concepts and put them in the hands of developers.

**Some of the ways DreamFace helps to empower developers:**

* A Software Development PaaS enabling developers to collaborate in the development of Web and Mobile apps
* Built on Open Source technologies and Frameworks (NodeJS, AngularJS, Angular Material, MongoDB, GITHub…)
* Leverages all the capabilities and power of Fullstack development technologies
* Allows all levels of developers to contribute on the same project, each using a preferred technique to do so
* Designed to evolve architecturally but transparently to developers and user (such as adding a new open source framework, a new graphical component library, etc.)
* Structures the way developers need to use technologies by wrapping best practices around them and providing an easy way to leverage them in the application development process

Businesses also want to benefit from these new development methodologies and meet their development commitments but they often don't
have experience with cloud technologies. DreamFace allows businesses to take advantage of the flexibility offered by new open
source technologies by providing an integrated development environment with built-in and ready to use best practices for
building and deploying complex applications. It is open and extensible allowing businesses to integrate extisting code and
resources and to customize and extend their DreamFace development environment and their own applications. DreamFace was built
to help developers and businesses reap the benefits of using new components and technologies to:

* **Create modern and beautiful User Interfaces**
* **Integrete back-end data sources coming from any API**
* **Interface with existing applications and legacy technology**
* **Use containerization and virtualization to scale the applications in the cloud**

Like many frameworks and platforms, DreamFace was created to help reduce the amount of work to build consistently good applications.
There are  a lot of great developers in the world and many more will come with the new coding initiatives. The problem isn’t
really knowing how to use HTML or CSS, or Angular or any other new technology that comes along. The problem is knowing all of
the technologies necessary to build a really good application that works in the cloud and scale and that can evolve and
meet the ever changing business requirements.

The goal of DreamFace is to reduce the need to know every technology in depth by providing built-in best practices for error handling,
API integration, security, version management, remote team development, build management and deployment and containerization to name a few.
DreamFace provides and open and exetensible environment where the developer is empowered to use their skills to focus on
the functionality and providing a great user experience without rebuilding the wheel every time.
