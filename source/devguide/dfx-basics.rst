What is DreamFace?
==================

DreamFace is an open-source, :term:`cloud-native` development platform for creating enterprise web and mobile applications.

DreamFace X-Platform, (DFX) or just **DreamFace**, is part of an emerging category of :term:`cloud-native`, Rapid Application
Development (RAD) Platforms. It is built to empower :term:`Fullstack` developers to deliver consistently well-architected,
Enterprise-grade, :term:`cloud-native`,  web and mobile applications with ease and speed. DreamFace simplifies the delivery of
a new generation of cloud applications featuring uncompromising User Experiences and providing the right data on the right
device by secure and code-less consumption of virtually any public or private API.

DreamFace accelerates development and leaves room for developer creativity to solve complex business problems by removing much
of the heavy-lifting in writing application logic, connecting to multiple data sources, providing security and packaging
applications. Developers focus their development on creating a compelling user experience with reduced coding required thanks to
a comprehensive integration of backend services with codelss consumption or APIs.

DreamFace was created to ease development of two difficult and time consuming tasks:

* **User Interface** - industrialize and simplify the creation of beautiful, complex user interfaces for multiples screens
* **Back-End Data Integration** - codeless and secure intregration of virtually any API or back-end data source

DreamFace is built on the MEAN Stack, MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angularjs and Nodejs.

DreamFace applications are:

* modular built from a composition of user interface and data access components
* :term:`cloud-native` and :term:`multi-tenant` right out of the box
* multi-platform by nature, the underlying :term:`UI` is based on Angular Material
* based on best of breed, open-source technologies that are the foundation of the internet applications today
* are architected to scale to the limits of the cloud
* open-source but also open and extensible

DreamFace accelerates development with a visual Editor for creating rich user interfaces with drag and drop development.
In the View Editor, pre-defined graphical controls are dragged on to an panel and properties and attributes are set,
minimizing the coding required and allowing developers to focus on creating the user,experience. Developers can drop into code
when the user interface requires specific customization and they have always have access to underlying assets
of the application in the DreamFace Repository which contains a description of each component in JSON format.

Who is DreamFace for?
=====================

**DreamFace is for Developers**

DreamFace was built to empower :term:`Full Stack` developers by leveraging best of breed technologies like Angularjs, Nodejs
and MongoDB, technologies that were the backbone of the internets most demanding applications. DreamFace embraces these
new technologies, providing an open and extensible platform with built-in best practices for building cloud-native web and
mobile applications. Multi-tenancy, API integration and enterprise-scale features are built-in and ready to use to help
developers deliver consistently well architected and scalable applications every time.


Because of it's modular approach to development, DreamFace allows teams of different skill levels to work together and leverage
each others skills to the benefit the project. For example, a developer who is much better at building the user interface and
knows web technologies could create the Views and Pages (compositions of Views) and application branding and a developer
with more backend skills could create the API Services that access the backend data. Then just put them together to visualize
the data in the Views and Pages. The same API Services can be used for both web and mobile applications.

Developers don’t have to be experts in each individual language to put together applications and services.

What you need to know
=====================

DreamFace is a platform that empowers :term:`Full Stack`  and :term:`Mean Stack` developers.

Developers can focus thier efforts on building a great user experience with the rapid application development features in
the DreamFace Studio and take advantage of the application infrastructure, packaging and deployment that DreamFace supplies
out of the box.

To get the maximum benefit from DreamFace developers should have a working knowledge of the following technologies :

* Standard Web Technologies (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript)
* Angular.js
* MongoDB
* Node.js

Developers don’t have to be experts in each individual language to put together applications and services with DreamFace but
understanding the basics of the underlying technologies is important.

Other technologies that are good to know :

* Angular Material
* REST Services
* Jade
* JQuery
