What is DreamFace?
------------------

DreamFace is an open-source, :term:`cloud-native` development platform for creating enterprise web and mobile applications.

DreamFace X-Platform, (DFX) or just **DreamFace**, is part of an emerging category of :term:`cloud-native`, Rapid Application
Development (RAD) Platforms. It is built to empower :term:`Full-Stack` developers to deliver consistently well-architected,
Enterprise-grade, :term:`cloud-native`,  web and mobile applications with ease and speed. DreamFace simplifies the delivery of
a new generation of cloud applications featuring uncompromising User Experiences and providing the right data on the right
device by secure and code-less consumption of virtually any public or private API.

DreamFace was created to ease development of two difficult and time consuming tasks:

* **User Interface** - to industrialize and simplify the creation of beautiful, complex user interfaces for multiples screens
* **Back-End Data Integration** - to integrate backend services via codeless and secure intregration of virtually any API or back-end data source

DreamFace empowers developers with a powerful development studio offering editors for creating Views, API Services, Scripts,
Pages Templates, Menus and Styling to name a few. Developers focus their development on creating a compelling user experience
leveraging team skills and creating reusable components that can be used to assemble different applications.

DreamFace is built on the MEAN Stack, MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angularjs and Nodejs.

DreamFace applications are:

* modular built from a composition of user interface and data access components
* :term:`cloud-native` and :term:`multi-tenant` right out of the box
* multi-platform by nature, the underlying :term:`UI` is based on Angular Material
* based on best of breed, open-source technologies that are the foundation of the internet applications today
* are architected to scale
* open-source, open and extensible

Who is DreamFace for?
---------------------

**DreamFace is for Developers**

DreamFace was built to empower :term:`Full-Stack` developers by leveraging best of breed technologies like Angularjs, Nodejs
and MongoDB, technologies that were the backbone of the internets most demanding applications. DreamFace embraces these
new technologies, providing an open and extensible platform with built-in best practices for building cloud-native web and
mobile applications. Multi-tenancy, API integration and enterprise-scale features are built-in and ready to use to help
developers deliver consistently well architected and scalable applications every time.


Because of it's modular approach to development, DreamFace allows teams of different skill levels to work together and leverage
each others skills to the benefit the project. For example, a developer who is much better at building the user interface and
knows web technologies could create the Views and Pages (compositions of Views) and application branding and a developer
with more backend skills could create the API Services that access the backend data. Then just put them together to visualize
the data in the Views and Pages. The same API Services can be used for both web and mobile applications.

Developers don’t have to be experts in each individual language to put together applications and services.
