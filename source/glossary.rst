    Angular
        AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular") is an open-source front-end javascript framework for extending  and adding interactivity to HTML to meet the challenges of single page applications (SPA). It was created and is maintained by Google and a community of developers. The goal of Angular is to simplify the development and the testing of the user interface of SPA applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, as well as other components commonly used in rich Internet applications. Angular is used intensly in DreamFace to do the data binding between the view (user interface) and the model (application data).
    API
        Application Programming Interface (API) - Definition of call parameters to enable an application to access IT services for example to access back-ed data sources. APIs are consumed by the GUI but remain independent components offering a loosely coupled interaction of visual and data components.
    API Services
        API Services are is a DreamFace component for defining a logical group of API Routes.

    BlueMix
        BlueMix is the name of the IBM Cloud Platform with the goal helping software developers rapidly build, manage and run web and mobile applications by combining services to create applications.
    Bootstrap
        An open-source CSS library that provides templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components to make web applications responsive.
    Cloud App Platform
        A Cloud App Platform
    container
        Virtual software container, for example Docker, packaging different software together in an independent component simplifying light weight application deployment in the cloud.
    controller
        Controller refers to the angularJS controller which connects the view (UI) and the model (data) together. The default panel in a DreamFace widget has a controller which contains all of the scripting for the widget.
    data binding
        Data binding is the concept of linking the user interface and applciaton data (model) through the the applcation controller in an MVC architecture.
    DataQuery
        DataQuery refers to one of the main components of a DreamFace application, a reusable query component which defines how to access backend data such as REST APIs, MongoDB Database, External Databases and SOAP services.
        With this definition DreamFace creates the request for the query, accesses the metadata and data without coding. You can then bind the DataQuery to the fields of a DataWidgets to display the data in a DreamFace application.
    DataWidget
        DataWidget is one of the main DreamFace components. It is a visual component which contains graphical controls linked to DataQueries to display information and data. DataWidgets are displayed in a composition on a screen to
        create the user interface of a DreamFace application. DataWidgets can be created visually with the Widget Editor or in the Jade Widget Editor where the Jade templating language for Express/Node.js is used. DreamFace has two
        Widget Editors for visually composing widgets, one for create widgets for web applications and one for creating widgets for Mobile applications.
    DFX
        DreamFace X-Platform (DFX) or just DreamFace, is a cloud application platform for developing web and mobile applications.
    Docker
        A technology for automating deployment of applications inside software containers.
    feature set
        Feature set refers to the set of functionalities or capabilitities that are present in a software application. DreamFace has a full feature set for enterprise application development.
    framework
        A framework refers to a collection of libraries/classes with the common goal of providing a scaffold on which to build software. Frameworks might completely alter how you implement your program or they might just speed up common tasks. Example usage: "I built this app using an MVC framework for the backend."
    grunt
        A command-line utility for running build scripts.
    Hexadecimal Colors
        Hexadecimal color values are supported in all major browsers. A hexadecimal color is specified in the following format: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color. All values must be between 00 and FF. For example, the #ff0000 value is rendered as red, since the red component is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to 00. #000000 if black and #ffffff is white.
    IaaS
        Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a fundamental service model of cloud computing where servers, storage and networking are virtualized and provided on demand, in a pay-as-you-go model.
    multi-tenant

    module
        A module is a component that performs an entity of work composed of collection of tasks, functions or features. In nodejs it refers to a collection of packages that perform specific tasks that can
        be installed using npm. They can be combined with other
    MEAN
        An emerging technology stack for building modern web and mobile applications in javascript from client to server. MEAN is an acronym that stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angularjs and Node.js.

    MVC
        Model View Controller (MVC) architecture.
    Node
        NodeJS (commonly referred to as Node) is an asynchronous application server using javascript programming language.
    npm
        Node Package Manager (npm) is a tool that makes installing and managing Node modules easier, you can use it to install node programs, in development, it makes it easier to specify and link dependencies.rich-internet applications
    PaaS
        Platform as a Service (PaaS) can refer to many things, in our context it refers to a cloud computing application development platform for simplifying and accelerating the development, testing and deployment of cloud web and mobile applications. The developer builds and deploys the application directly into this layer. PaaS extends and abstracts the IaaS layer by removing the management of the individual virtual machine.
    responsive
        As in responsive web design, this is a way to define a web application to provide an optimal user experience across multiple devices from desktop browsers to mobile phone and tablet browsers.
    REST
        REST
    SaaS
        Software as a Service (SaaS) (also known as On-Demand Software) is a software distribution model in which software applications are hosted by a cloud service provider and made available to customers over internet on a subscription basis. Typically there is one application shared by all users or tenants via a web browser.
    SOAP
        SOAP
    SPA
        In a Single-Page Applications (SPA), the entire application runs as a single web page. The entire first page is loaded in the browser after the initial request to the server, subsequent interactions only replace parts of the first page that need to be updated. This approach eliminates the need to reload the entire page and is more efficient, reducing the time taken by the application to respond to user actions. The presentation layer for the entire application is factored out of pieces from the server and is managed in the browser.

    VM
        Virtual Machine
    VPN
        A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network such as the Internet. It enables a computer to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it is directly connected to the private network, while benefiting from the functionality, security and management policies of the private network.
    Yeoman
        Command-line utility written in Node.js which combines several functions into one place, such as generating a starter template, managing dependencies, running unit tests, providing a local development server, and optimizing production code for deployment.
