    AngularJS
        AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular") is an open-source front-end javascript framework for extending  and adding interactivity to HTML to meet the challenges of single page applications (SPA). It was created and is maintained by Google and a community of developers. The goal of Angular is to simplify the development and the testing of the user interface of SPA applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, as well as other components commonly used in rich Internet applications. Angular is used intensly in DreamFace to do the data binding between the view (user interface) and the model (application data).
    Angular Expression
        An expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value. The value may be a number, a string, or a logical value.
    Angular Material
        Angular Material is an implementation of :term:`Material Design` in Angular.js. This project provides a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components based on the Material Design system. DreamFace uses Angular Material for most of the graphical components provided in the DreamFace Studio.
    API
        Application Programming Interface (API) - Definition of call parameters to enable an application to access IT services for example to access back-ed data sources. APIs are consumed by the GUI but remain independent components offering a loosely coupled interaction of visual and data components.
    API Services
        API Services are is a DreamFace component for defining a logical group of API Routes.
    API Routes
        API Routes are one of the main components of a DreamFace application. They define how to access backend data such as REST APIs, MongoDB Database, External Databases and SOAP services. With this definition DreamFace creates the request, accesses the metadata and data. You can then bind the API Route to the fields of a View to display the data in a DreamFace application.
    API Route
        DataQuery refers to one of the main components of a DreamFace application, a reusable query component which defines how to access backend data such as REST APIs, MongoDB Database, External Databases and SOAP services.
        With this definition DreamFace creates the request for the query, accesses the metadata and data without coding. You can then bind the DataQuery to the fields of a DataWidgets to display the data in a DreamFace application.

    SPA
        In a Single-Page Applications (SPA), the entire application runs as a single web page. The entire first page is loaded in the browser after the initial request to the server, subsequent interactions only replace parts of the first page that need to be updated. This approach eliminates the need to reload the entire page and is more efficient, reducing the time taken by the application to respond to user actions. The presentation layer for the entire application is factored out of pieces from the server and is managed in the browser.
    tenant
        Tenant refers to client of a DreamFace application. In DreamFace each tenant has it's own repository where all application settings, data and components are stored. A tenant can represent an environment (ie. dev, test, prod), a business unit (ie. marketing, sales), an organization (ie. Acme, Durant) or an application (ie. demo, crm, portal).
