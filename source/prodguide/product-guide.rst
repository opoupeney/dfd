DreamFace Philosophy
===================

The creators of DreamFace are all seasoned vetrans of Enterprise Development and Development Platforms. We built DreamFace
with the features that we would want as enterprise developers of applications that have to connect and scale in one of most
challenging application development eras in history with pieces coming from everywhere and new technologies arriving almost
daily. DreamFace helps with the difficult issues in building complex applications. We built DreamFace to provide
the most benefit when the application gets more complex. DreamFace was built to do the heavy lifting while you focus on your
business value.

Below you will find some of the features that you too would expect from a modern enterprise development platform and
also some of our own personal touch that makes DreamFace unique.

Feature List

DreamFace-powered applications use Angular and Angular Material to deliver desktop-like interactivity without a plug-in or
install and work across the most popular browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari). Developers use a visual form

experiences and unlock new application value. You can also extend DreamFace and create your own unique graphical controls.
