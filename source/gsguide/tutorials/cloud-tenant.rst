Setting Up Your Cloud Tenant
============================

Multitenancy refers to a principle in software architecture where a single instance of the software (i.e DreamFace) runs on a server, serving multiple client-organizations (tenants).
Multitenancy contrasts with multi-instance architectures where separate software instances (or hardware systems) operate on behalf of different client organizations.
To simplify, many different clients-organizations can share the same mulitenant application and only one client-organization uses the software instance application.

You can use the multitenancy in DreamFace to suit your infrastructure needs. For example, a tenant can represent:

* An environment (ex: dev, test, prod)
* A business unit (ex: marketing, sales, finance)
* An organization (ex: acme, durant)
* An application domain (ex: demo, crm, portal)

In most cases, an on-premise installation will use multitenancy to refer to multiple environments. In this tutorial you will learn :
