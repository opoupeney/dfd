Welcome to the DreamFace Studio!

When you first arrive you will notice that page is divided into four sections :

1. **Logo and Version Number**
2. **Icon Bar**
3. **Explorer Panel**
4. **Landing Page and Workspace**


Let's explore each of these sections

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the upper left corner of the page is the DreamFace logo and Version number. The version number indicates the version of
DreamFace being used.


Icon Bar

In the upper right section is the Icon Bar. The Icon Bar is a tool bar that goes across the top of the browser page which
contains icons for different operations that can be performed.

hierarchy of applications and their components as well as components shared by all applications. It provides search capabilities
on the components and a direct access menu for quick access to main application editors in the studio without having to
navigating through the hierarchy ofcomponents.
