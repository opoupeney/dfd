Cloud Database
==============

If you are builing a cloud application, your data needs to be accessible from the cloud. If your data is on your local
machine you will either have to move it to a server that is accessible from the cloud or you may want to move it to a
cloud-based database. DreamFace provides an interface to help you create your and store your data in the cloud. The cloud
database uses a noSQL data model that runs on MongoDB. The data stored in the cloud database will be easily accessible to
your application.

The Cloud Database can be created and managed directly from the DreamFace Platform. It can be used for storing application
data or for building prototypes that need sample data. In this tutorial you will learn :
