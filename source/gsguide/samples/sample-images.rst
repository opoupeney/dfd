Basics
------

Basic Button samples show different labels, icons and colors. They have no event actions and therefore do nothing when clicked, etc.

Styles

Styles samples show examples of a color, shape and label changes (the first three buttons). The fab button with a
heart icon applies a dynamic class property to change the color of a heart when clicked. The last button in this category
has a drop-down menu which is activated by clicking on the arrow on the right hand side
