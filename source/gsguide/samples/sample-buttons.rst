Sample Categories - different kinds of Buttons are provided as examples:

|

Basics
------

Basic Button samples show different labels, icons and colors. They have no event actions and therefore do nothing when clicked, etc.

The sample basic buttons include:

* a button with a label
* a button with an icon
* a button with a label and an icon on the right
* a button with a label and an icon on the left.

Flex width
----------

Flex Width Buttons show how button width can either be determined by the width of the label or be set by the flex value provided.

The samples include:

A Button with the label *FLEX 20*.

* The width is auto-sized based on the width of the label.

Styles
------

Styles samples show examples of a color, shape and label changes (the first three buttons). The fab button with a
heart icon applies a dynamic class property to change the color of a heart when clicked. The last button in this category
has a drop-down menu which is activated by clicking on the arrow on the right hand side

Disable, visible / invisible
----------------------------

In this category we see an example of the wait property to display a loading effect when a button is pressed. Also we have an example of a "visible / invisible button". Clicking "SHOW NEXT" triggers appearance of another button which displays a dialog box when pressed.
