<dt id="term-angular">Angular</dt>
<dd>AngularJS (commonly referred to as &#8220;Angular&#8221;) is an open-source front-end javascript framework for extending  and adding interactivity to HTML to meet the challenges of single page applications (SPA). It was created and is maintained by Google and a community of developers. The goal of Angular is to simplify the development and the testing of the user interface of SPA applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, as well as other components commonly used in rich Internet applications. Angular is used intensly in DreamFace to do the data binding between the view (user interface) and the model (application data).</dd>
<dt id="term-angular-material">Angular Material</dt>
<dd>Angular Material is an implementation of Material Design in Angular.js. This project provides a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components based on the Material Design system. DreamFace uses Angular Material for most of the graphical components provided in the DreamFace Studio.</dd>
<dt id="term-api">API</dt>

APIs are consumed by the GUI but remain independent components offering a loosely coupled interaction of visual and data components.</dd>
<dt id="term-api-services">API Services</dt>
<dd>API Services are is a DreamFace component for defining a logical group of API Routes.</dd>

<dt id="term-dataquery">DataQuery</dt>
<dd>DataQuery refers to one of the main components of a DreamFace application, a reusable query component which defines how to access backend data such as REST APIs, MongoDB Database, External Databases and SOAP services.
With this definition DreamFace creates the request for the query, accesses the metadata and data without coding. You can then bind the DataQuery to the fields of a DataWidgets to display the data in a DreamFace application.</dd>
<dt id="term-dfx">DFX</dt>

<dt id="term-feature-set">feature set</dt>
<dd>Feature set refers to the set of functionalities or capabilitities that are present in a software application. DreamFace has a full feature set for enterprise application development.</dd>
<dt id="term-framework">framework</dt>
<dd>A framework refers to a collection of libraries/classes with the common goal of providing a scaffold on which to build software. Frameworks might completely alter how you implement your program or they might just speed up common tasks. Example usage: &#8220;I built this app using an MVC framework for the backend.&#8221;</dd>
<dt id="term-full-stack-developer">Full stack developer</dt>
<dd>A Full stack developer is a developer that can develop both the client and server sides of an application and who has familiarity at each layer of the technology stack from UX/UI to APIs to Data Modeling, Business Logic and Sever.</dd>
<dt id="term-grunt">grunt</dt>
<dd>A command-line utility for running build scripts.</dd>
<dt id="term-hexadecimal-colors">Hexadecimal Colors</dt>
<dd>Hexadecimal color values are supported in all major browsers. A hexadecimal color is specified in the following format: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color. All values must be between 00 and FF. For example, the #ff0000 value is rendered as red, since the red component is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to 00. #000000 if black and #ffffff is white.</dd>
<dt id="term-iaas">IaaS</dt>
<dd>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a fundamental service model of cloud computing where servers, storage and networking are virtualized and provided on demand, in a pay-as-you-go model.</dd>
<dt id="term-multitenancy">multitenancy</dt>
<dd>Multitenancy refers to a software architecture where one instance of a software application (ie. DreamFace) runs on one server and serves multiple tenants or clients where each client is a tenant.</dd>
<dt id="term-module">module</dt>
<dd>A module is a component that performs an entity of work composed of collection of tasks, functions or features. In nodejs it refers to a collection of packages that perform specific tasks that can
be installed using npm. They can be combined with other</dd>
<dt id="term-mean-stack">MEAN Stack</dt>
<dd>An emerging technology stack for building modern web and mobile applications in javascript from client to server. MEAN is an acronym that stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angularjs and Node.js.</dd>

<dt id="term-paas">PaaS</dt>
<dd>Platform as a Service (PaaS) can refer to many things, in our context it refers to a cloud computing application development platform for simplifying and accelerating the development, testing and deployment of cloud web and mobile applications.

<dt id="term-soap">SOAP</dt>
<dd>SOAP, originally an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.</dd>
<dt id="term-spa">SPA</dt>
<dd>In a Single-Page Applications (SPA), the entire application runs as a single web page. The entire first page is loaded in the browser after the initial request to the server, subsequent interactions only replace parts of the first page that need to be updated. This approach eliminates the need to reload the entire page and is more efficient, reducing the time taken by the application to respond to user actions. The presentation layer for the entire application is factored out of pieces from the server and is managed in the browser.</dd>
<dt id="term-tenant">tenant</dt>
<dd>Tenant refers to client of a DreamFace application. In DreamFace each tenant has it&#8217;s own repository where all application settings, data and components are stored. A tenant can represent an environment (ie. dev, test, prod), a business unit (ie. marketing, sales), an organization (ie. Acme, Durant) or an application (ie. demo, crm, portal).</dd>
