Introdcution



The Getting Started Tutorials are meant to introduce you to important DreamFace concepts to get you started, as quickly as possible,on the right track to building your first DreamFace application. In the tutorials you will learn best practices for building cloud applications with DreamFace with a focus on how to get the most benefit from the many buit-in features provided in the platform.


What is DreamFace?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
DreamFace is a development platform that empowers developers to create cloud-based desktop or mobile cross-platform business applications.

DreamFace X-Platform (DFX or just DreamFace as we will refer to it in this documentation) is a part of emerging category of cloud-based Rapid Application Development Platforms for delivering Enterprise scale Web and Mobile applications with ease and speed, producing uncompromising User Experiences, and delivering the right data to the right user on the right device by secure and code-less consumption of any public or private API.

DreamFace accelerates development with a Widget Editor providing drag and drop development. In the Widget Editor, pre-defined graphical controls are dragged on to an panel and properties and attributes are set, minimizing the coding required and allowing developers to focus on creating the user experience. Developers can drop into code when the user interface requires specific customization and they have always have access to underlying assets of the application in the DreamFace Repository which contains a description of each component in JSON format.

DreamFace was created to ease development of two difficult and time consuming tasks:

* **User Interface** - industrialize and simplify the creation of beautiful, complex user interfaces for multiples screens
* **Back-End Data Integration** - codeless and secure intregration of virtually any API or back-end data source

The X-Platform part of the DreamFace name refers to the cross platform development. With DreamFace you can build applications for web or mobile with dedicated editors for creating the user interface for web and mobile environments. DreamFace offers several options. You can create a responsive web application that adapts to web and mobile use by adjusting to the screen size of the device automatically in a responsive way or you can create specific Web and Mobile versions of your application that reuse the same back-end query components. In the case of mobile deployment DreamFace provides tools to create cross platform mobile versions of your application. This flexibility lets you decide which is the best platform for your application.


Who is DreamFace for?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Developers**

DreamFace was built to empower developers by giving them a platform with built-in best practices for SaaS / Cloud and Mobile applications. Multi-tenancy and enterprise-scale features are built-in and ready to use helping the developer to deliver consistently well architected and scalable application every time.

Because of it's modular approach to development, DreamFace allows teams of different skill levels to work together and leverage each others skills to the benefit of the project. For example, a developer who is much better at building the user interface and knows web technologies could create the DataWidgets, Application Screens (compositions of DataWidgets) and application branding and a developer with more backend skills could create the DataQueries that access the backend data. Then just put them together to visualise the data. The same DataQueries can be used for both web and mobile applications.

* **Business Managers**

Business Managers and Project Managers with knowledge of the application with minimal skills in web technologies can still use DreamFace in a top down approach to create application prototypes. We will cover Top Down development with DreamFace in a separate tutorial.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DreamFace is a platform that empowers Full Stack developers. Developers can leverage it to take care of the application infrastructure and focus their efforts on building great user experience and applications.
