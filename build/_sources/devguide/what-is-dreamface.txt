What is DreamFace?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*DreamFace is an open-source development platform for creating modular and dynamic, cloud-native desktop and mobile applications and the
API Routes to access back-end APIs*

DreamFace X-Platform (**DFX**) or just DreamFace, is a part of emerging category of cloud-native, RAD (Rapid Application Development) Platforms
for delivering Enterprise scale Desktop and Mobile applications with ease and speed, producing uncompromising User Experiences, and delivering
the right data to the right user on the right device by secure and code-less consumption of any public or private API.

DreamFace accelerates development with a Visual Editors providing drag and drop development. In the View Editor, pre-defined
graphical controls are dragged on to a panel layout grid of rows and columns, properties and attributes are set, minimizing
the coding required and allowing developers to focus on creating a great user experience. Developers can drop into code when the user
interface requires specific customization and they have always have access to underlying assets of the application in the DreamFace
Repository which contains a description of each component in JSON format.

DreamFace was created to ease development of two difficult and time consuming tasks:

* **User Interface** - industrialize and simplify the creation of beautiful, complex user interfaces for multiples screens
* **Back-End Data Integration** - codeless and secure intregration of virtually any API or back-end data source

DreamFace applications are a composition of user interface and data access components. In DreamFace these are called Views and API Routes.
Applications are a composition of Views and API Routes dispayed on Pages with application flow driven by a Navigation Menu.

DreamFace is built on the MEAN Stack technologies (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angularjs and Nodejs) that have grown up by powering the internet.
